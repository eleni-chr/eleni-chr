### Hi, ðŸ‘‹

I am a neuroscientist currently trying to discover more about neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. I regularly write code for data analysis for my experiments.

- For image processing and analysis I use MATLAB and ImageJ (Java-based).
- For bioinformatics analysis I use R, and data processing toolkits run via the Linux and Windows command lines.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:

Writing MATLAB functions for analysing microscopy images.

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:

- Object oriented programming
- How to create graphical user interfaces in MATLAB
- How to apply machine learning merthods for data classification and prediction
- Methods for signal frequency analysis
