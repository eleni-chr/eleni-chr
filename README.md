### ðŸ‘‹ Hi,

I am a neuroscientist currently trying to discover more about neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation. I regularly write code for data analysis for my experiments and for fun.

- For microscopy image processing and analysis I use MATLAB and the Java-based image analysis software ImageJ.
- For bioinformatics analysis (data from RNA sequencing) I use R, and data processing toolkits run via the Linux and Windows command lines.

My older repositories include functions I wrote for practice when learning to code. My newer repositories include functions I wrote for my own data analysis at work.

Check out my website/blog: [www.elenichr.com][1]

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:

- Writing functions for analysing microscopy images.

## ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:

- Object oriented programming
- How to create graphical user interfaces in MATLAB
- How to apply machine learning methods for data classification and prediction
- Methods for signal frequency analysis
